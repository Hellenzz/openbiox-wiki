## Organizational Structure and Features

Following the flat management idea, it consists of the Standing Committee, the Project Action Team, and the sponsor. Organization members have no hierarchical relationship during the project, and all actions that are harmful to openbiox development or split openbiox are eliminated.

1. **Standing Committee:** At the beginning of March each year, all members voted for 14-18 persons. Each member of the Standing Committee shall assume clear management responsibilities for a term of one year and implement a rotation system for every two Two of them are responsible for the main things in openbiox during the week. In addition, 6 people are required to be the standing committee rotation staff (quality project proponents, active contributors, helpful people, etc.) as the openbiox management talent echelon construction project. Candidates for the general election of the Standing Committee shall be nominated by members of the Standing Committee and approved by more than half of the members of the Standing Committee. In general, candidates for the Standing Committee should have at least 4-5 conditions below (if they are other special talents, they can also be nominated):

    -  High recognition and a strong passion for openbiox
    -  conscientious
    -  Strong learning, independent thinking, and innovation
    -  Strong teamwork, project management, and organizational coordination
    -  Have a certain appeal and influence in the bioinformatics community
    -  Application experience of the National Natural Science Foundation and other research projects
    -  Have Chinese core or SCI article writing and publishing experience
    -  Have initiated/contributed open source project experience
    -  Expertise in some of the much-needed bioinformatics research/application directions
 
The main duties of the Standing Committee are:

    -  Organize team building activities
    -  Promote team project results
    -  Management team funds revenue and expenditure
    -  Organizing project creative discussions
    -  Allocate the resources required for the project
    -  Supervise project execution progress
    -  Assess project completion
    -  Monitoring academic misconduct

2. **Project Action Team:** Voluntary choice of members to join, provide openbiox bioinformatics project ideas and carry out the actual development, testing, release, operation, and maintenance of the project. The practice group is composed according to the number of project creativity, member interests, and skills. In principle, each practice group contains at least one standing committee member and one technical instructor.

3. **Sponsor:** An individual or institution inside or outside openbiox. All grants should be registered regardless of the amount of money, and all members should be grateful and cherished, and provide certain privileges (such as priority use of resources, the priority of introductory rights, provision of open source project homepages or advertisements for documents, etc.).

## Recruitment and exit

**Recruitment mechanism**

1. Online promotion at the end of February and early March each year, recruiting openbiox members with high self-drive by submitting resumes and email applications. The new application must be approved by half of the members of the Standing Committee to join openbiox. After the completion of the centralized management, the Standing Committee election will be held and the next year's work plan and process will be entered.
2. During the term of the members of the Standing Committee, new members may be recommended by any member of the Standing Committee, and the relevant recommenders shall be approved by half of the members of the Standing Committee. Members of the Standing Committee, each with a recommended number of five people per year.
3. Co-applied by the Principal of Practice and its member of the Standing Committee, mainly for recruitment: the project carries out urgently needed relevant professionals; actively participate in open source practice projects and strongly hopes to join openbiox. The relevant application requires half of the members of the Standing Committee to agree to pass.

**Meeting mechanism**

In order to guarantee the start-up expenses of some projects and increase the enthusiasm of the project of openbiox members, we plan to collect all project members' construction funds (not more than 100 yuan) after the annual regular new ones, special circumstances (such as providing other means of equal funding) And important contributions to openbiox construction and practice projects) should be exempted and returned. Other openbiox members who join the unconventional time are also required to pay, and the special circumstances can be waived as well.

**Exit mechanism**

Members who want to voluntarily withdraw from openbiox need to apply to the Standing Committee and indicate the detailed reasons. They also need to hand over the project they are responsible for/participate and give up all the rights that the project may bring (special circumstances are supported by the Standing Committee and Practice group members discuss the decision).

openbiox welcomes all friends who are passionate, responsible, knowledgeable, capable and self-motivated. For members who do not care, do not respond, or participate in openbiox discussions, exchanges, practices, etc., we will persuade them to withdraw (solicit their final opinion and vote of all members of the Standing Committee). If a member does not respond and contribute to all of openbiox's activities and practice projects for 2 consecutive months, it will by default be considered an unsolicited exit from the openbiox committee.

All internal shared project ideas (not fully public) proposed by openbiox members, all members must not be open to non-openbiox personnel. If members need to independently conduct relevant research or development activities based on creative projects proposed by other openbiox members (such as further expansion and transformation of the project's creative content), they should communicate with the project creative proposer and the standing committee members in advance, and need to follow up the research. The source of the original creative idea is indicated in the activity, and the creative person is given the corresponding rights and thanks. If there is a misappropriation of the creativity and labor of others without the permission of others, it will be directly delisted and made public on the whole network.

All withdrawal requests will be set for one-week buffer time. Members have one and only one chance to voluntarily withdraw the withdrawal request during the buffer period. The reason for the withdrawal is required.

## Member online communication way

Online communication and important information notifications related to team activities and work are published on the “nailing” platform, and records are kept for review. Life-related information is published in the WeChat group.

Collaboration on all bioinformatics open source projects is based on the open source code hosting site [GitHub-openbiox] (https://github.com/openbiox). Other online instant communication methods are determined by internal discussions in the practice group. Some important communication or event information is shared or saved as screenshots for later publicity.

## Practice project development process

Creative ideas: impromptu brain holes (usually at any time) and focused discussions (in the first two weeks of March).

In order to prevent the project from being too rampant and casual, the members of the Standing Committee initiated the Epiphany Brain Practice Project (with no time limit for initiation), which can initiate different levels of practice within openbiox during the term of its tenure with other at least three members of the Standing Committee. The innovative project was approved by more than half of the members of the Standing Committee and was initiated after the number of respondents met the project requirements. Other members can initiate it after communicating with a member of the Standing Committee (the members of the Standing Committee are strictly prohibited to ask for relevant interests, and if the relevant circumstances occur, they will be deprived of their standing membership).

The focused discussion was mainly during the project creative meeting in the first two weeks of March, during which all openbiox members brainstormed, collected and collated all the projects that may be carried out and carried out this year, and focused on providing human, financial and equipment support. s project. The start of the meeting should be completed no later than the second week of March after the Standing Committee has confirmed it.

**Practical project creative collection method:**

1. Project ideas that are open to everyone: Submit Issues for distribution at https://github.com/openbiox/openbiox-public-ideas.
2. Project ideas open to all openbiox members: submitted by nailing daily.

After the project creative brainstorming session, the Standing Committee will discuss and review the projects to be newly funded and launched this year, and all members will freely decide whether to apply for participation. All non-full-participating practice projects need to set a certain number of participants and personnel screening requirements, and screening and forming a small team among all applicants. Each person should participate in at least one small practice team each year and contribute at least one practice project (not less than a certain amount of work). At least three workloads and project progress assessments should be conducted each year, and personnel adjustments and project progress planning should be carried out for small teams that are unqualified or whose project progress is not in line with expectations.

For key support projects with large capital use and high labor costs, a more detailed project plan should be provided as the basis for review and key review. The main auditing perspectives include at least two of the following: feasibility, innovation, practicality, audience broad, and potential impact.

The proponent of the project idea can choose to participate in the completion and release of the project at the same time. Finally, the project practitioner and all members of the organization share the intellectual property rights, and the equity ratio is determined by the former two. If the project generates revenue, the third portion of the equity will go directly to the organizational resource pool for use by the openbiox project.

All projects are proposed, participated, completed, and managers should write project insights, reflections, and gains after the project are completed, and publish them within the organization or in public media.

## Project resource source, sharing, and distribution

The project resources are mainly from the donation or sharing of members in the organization (mainly including funds, equipment, venues, technical guidance), out-of-organization sponsorship (general users, commercial companies), universities/institutions/national funds, and the income of all projects in the previous year. Divided into.

All resources owned by the organization need to enter the “resource pool”, which is allocated by the Standing Committee based on the specific workload of the project, the user needs, the skills of the practice group, and the number of participants. If the Resource Pool does not meet the support requirements at some time, it may be necessary for the project manager and its Standing Committee members to initiate donations or reinforcement initiatives within and outside the organization.

## Proposed to carry out innovative practice project types

1. Getting started and basic

  -  New and updated Wiki Wikipedia and Baidu Encyclopedia entries
  -  Translation and commentary of Chinese and English book materials
  -  Planning, writing/recording of text and video tutorials related to bioinformatics/programming skills

2. Advanced upgrade

  -  Verification, mining, and visualization of public databases and documents for application development
  -  Standardized development and construction of data analysis processes
  -  Initial application of statistical and machine learning algorithms (such as previous mathematics modeling contest title exercises and report writing)
  -  Disassembly and learning of high-quality open source project source code
  -  Reptile data collection

3. High-order transformation research

  -  Collection, collation, and construction of databases and knowledge bases for disease diagnosis and treatment (eg trait association of genetic test results, or target association of cancer gene test results)
  -  Clinical medical data analysis and application (eg medical image and image data processing based on machine learning and other algorithms, medical diagnosis and prognosis prediction robot)
  -  Multi-omics data integration algorithms and visualization application development; TB/PB level data analysis application development

## Project practice results exchange and sharing

Every year in the first week of October, an annual offline meeting is organized. Members of the organization vote to decide on the venue and city, and try to get sponsored resources to support the meeting. All practical projects, whether completed or not, need to be summarized and reported at the annual meeting: the main content includes the project progress process, presentation of results, on-site teaching and demonstration, experience summary and the participants' harvest and thinking. At the scene, the participants will vote according to certain scoring standards, and the ratings will be A, B, and C.

In view of the long-term implementation and maintenance of many open source projects, after the project is completed, the project leader and participants can choose whether to proceed (to be included in the new annual mission development plan) or transfer the maintenance rights of the corresponding project. If the person responsible for continuing maintenance cannot be found inside or outside the organization, the project will enter the Archive state, leaving only the readable permissions.

## Project supervision and review

In order to prevent waste of resources and embezzlement, at least one member of the Standing Committee will be appointed as a supervisor in each practice group. Supervisors need to communicate regularly with practice group members and resource providers to document and verify resource usage. At the same time, the Standing Committee regularly conducts inquiries and online/offline reviews of the projects undertaken, and jointly assesses the completion of the project, the enthusiasm of the members, the members' gains and growth, and conducts A, B, and C assessments. If the two consecutive audits are C, the Standing Committee has the right to change the project leader or adjust the project participants.

If the practice project participant applies to withdraw from the current project, it is necessary to apply to the project leader and the standing committee member for explanation and explain the reasons. If you want to participate in other projects that have already started to operate after the project is launched, you need to apply for approval from the responsible team leader and the standing committee members.

## Other

1. All openbiox members should prioritize their time and priorities for each type of task. They need to participate in or engage in openbiox event discussions and project practices after they have completed their daily learning and work tasks. Members who are unable to participate in relevant exchange discussions and their responsible project practice work due to various irresistible factors shall report to the members of the Standing Committee and their responsible project team and request relevant personnel to assist in the completion.
2. openbiox's various event notifications and free discussions should focus on non-working hours (7:00-9:00; 11:30-13:30; 17:00-24:00) to avoid affecting the normal work of members.
3. The Standing Committee will hold a regular meeting every two weeks. The main topics include:

  - Staff adjustments (such as discussions and voting on new and exits; departmental adjustments; additions and exclusions of project members)
  - Project progress arrangements and plans
  - Summarize the experience and difficulties encountered in the project and find potential solutions
  - ......
